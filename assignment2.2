"I shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt
suddenly as though I were talking to a child. Then he went
into the jewelry store to buy a pearl necklace—or perhaps

only a pair of cuff buttons—rid of my provincial squea-
mishness forever.

And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world,
I thought of Gatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the
green light at the end of Daisy’s dock. He had come a long
way to this blue lawn and his dream must have seemed so
close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know
that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast

obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the re-
public rolled on under the night.
