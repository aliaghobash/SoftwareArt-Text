#teenage rebellion song remix
Cigar = '''
Come in here, dear boy, have a cigar
You're gonna go far, you're gonna fly
You're never gonna die
You're gonna make it if you try
They're gonna love you
Well I've always had a deep respect
And I mean that most sincere
The band is just fantastic
That is really what I think
Oh by the way, which one's pink?
And did we tell you the name of the game, boy
We call it 'riding the gravy train'
We're just knocked out
We heard about the sell out
You gotta get an album out
You owe it to the people
We're so happy we can hardly count
Everybody else is just green
Have you seen the chart?
It's a helluva start
It could be made into a monster
If we all pull together as a team
And did we tell you the name of the game, boy
We call it 'riding the gravy train'

Brick ='''
We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teacher, leave them kids alone
Hey, teacher, leave them kids alone
All in all it's just another brick in the wall
All in all you're just another brick in the wall
We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers, leave them kids alone
Hey, teachers, leave those kids alone
All in all you're just another brick in the wall
All in all you're just another brick in the wall
Wrong, do it again
If you don't eat yer meat, you can't have any pudding
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat yer meat?
You! Yes, you behind the bikesheds, stand still laddy!

I'm taking a ride with my best friend
I hope he never lets me down again
He knows where he's taking me
Taking me where I want to be
I'm taking a ride with my best friend
We're flying high
We're watching the world pass us by
Never want to come down
Never want to put my feet back down on the ground
I'm taking a ride with my best friend
I hope he never lets me down again
Promises me I'm safe as houses
As long as I remember who's wearing the trousers
I hope he never lets me down again
We're flying high
We're watching the world pass us by
Never want to come down
Never want to put my feet back down on the ground
We're flying high
We're watching the world pass us by
Never want to come down
Never want to put my feet back down on the ground
Never let me down
Never let me down
Never let me down
Never let me down
See the stars, they're shining bright (never let me down)
Everything's alright tonight (never let me down)
See the stars, they're shining bright (never let me down)
Everything's alright tonight (never let me down)
See the stars, they're shining bright (never let me down)
Everything's alright tonight (never let me down)
See the stars, they're shining bright (never let me down)
